Topic 5: Recursion

** Program 4 delayed 2 days on both normal and late turn-in **

* Recursion is repetition (by self-reference)
  * it is caused when a function calls/invokes itself
  * such a process will repeat forever unless terminated by some control structure
* So far, we have learned about control structures that allow C++ to iterate a set of statements a number of times.
* In addition to iteration, C++ can repeat an action by having a function call itself
  * this is called recursion. In some cases it is more suitable than itertion
* While recursion is very powerful
  * and will allow us to at times to simply solve complex problems

  * What is the purpose of the folowing?
    void strange(void);
    int main()
    {
      cout << "Please enter a string" << endl;
      strange();
      cout << endl;
      return 0;
    }

    void strange(void)
    {
      char ch;
      cin.get(ch);
      if(ch != '\n')
      {
        strange();
        cout << ch;
      }
    }
