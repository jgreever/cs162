Structures
----------
1. Allows us to group data together!
2. Remember an array requires all elements to be the same data type

So what happens when we want to represent an inventory of information?
  - product name
  - barcode
  - description
  - price
  - distributor

Think about how hard it would be to represent this with just arrays

1) Start with the keyword 'struct'
2) Follow this with a "tag" name
/* This goes in the global area above and outside of main */
  struct product
  {
    char name[41];
    char description[131];
    float price;
    char distributor[113];
  }; /* This semicolon is required */

3. How do we use them?
  int main()
{
  product item;
  /* data_type variable */
  
  int i;
}

4. Accessing Members
  product item;
  cin.get(item.name,41,'\n');

  object.member 
  variable or object of type struct, . = direct member access operator, member/item name in array 

5. Passing structures as arguments
  1. Prototype:
    void inputinventory(product & an_item);
    /* NEVER pass a struct by value */
  2. Function call:
    product item;
    input_inventory(item);
    /* item = an object or variaable of type struct product */
