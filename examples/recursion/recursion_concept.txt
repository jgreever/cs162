1. Is the problem repetitive?
2. Is part of the problem repetitive?
   - have one function for the repetitive part (recursive)
     and another for the non-repetitive part 

For the repetitive part (recursion)
1. What is the most simple stopping condition? (base case)
   - what is it and what should we do?
2. Is there another stopping condition?
   - if so, what is it and what should we do?
3. What do I want to do in this function?
   - are we counting? outputing? compairing?
4. How do we get to the next smaller sub-problem?
   - This means: How do we call the function that will help 
     us ultimately reach our base stopping condition 
5. Is there anything else that needs to get done
