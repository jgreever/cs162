 * This program will use linear linked lists to
 * store data about 3 items: Name of my favorite thing,
 * description of the item, and how often I participate
 * with the item. It will store to a new LLL, display
 * contents of all items in the list, remove an item
 * by name, count the number of items in the list and
 * release all memory (destroy the lll).
